# Self Driving Car Simulation

Self Driving Car Simulation is a Python project designed to train and visualize a self-driving car navigating a track using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm.

Special thanks to Cheesy AI for the initial version of the software (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o-jMhXmmxA).

## 📌 Features

- Autonomous car simulation
- Training powered by the NEAT algorithm
- Interactive visualization of the learning process

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `neat-python`
- `pygame`
- `numpy`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running the project

To start the simulation, simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📖 NEAT: A brief explanation

NEAT is a neuro-genetic evolution algorithm that develops neural networks through a process similar to natural selection. This method allows the car to learn how to drive by gradually improving its performance.
